# Can't count on the user having local DNS (/etc/resolv.conf) configured to
# point to support DNS server deployed as part of the solution, so we bypass
# local hostname resolution and use dig command to get the application IP address 
# from the support DNS server directly using:
#     dig @<support_ip> <app_hostname> 
# The returned IP address is used to connect to the WordPress application, must
# also must set Host value in the HTTP header so teh connection is routed to 
# the WordPress application.
