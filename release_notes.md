# Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

### Load balancers: firewall zone settings are lost after a reboot

- After a reboot, the two interfaces of the load balancer VMs are now assigned to the correct firewall zones.

### DNS and DHCP services are not automatically restarted after a reboot of a support node

- These services are now started automatically after a reboot.

## OCP 4.2 Support

### Support for OpenShift Container Platform version 4.2

- This version of the playbooks now supports the deployment of OCP 4.2.

### Scaling an OCP 4.2 cluster with Red Hat CoreOS worker nodes

- OCP 4.2 supports worker/compute nodes running either Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 (RHEL).
- When an RHCOS worker node is added to the cluster, OCP 4.2 requires the approval of two Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).
- The scale.yml playbook has been modified to approve these CSRs when adding RHCOS nodes to the cluster.

### Scaling an OCP 4.2 cluster with Red Hat 7.6 worker nodes

- OCP 4.2 supports worker/compute nodes running either Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 (RHEL).
- Scaling an OCP 4.2 cluster with RHEL worker nodes requires the use of an updated version of the OpenShift Ansible playbooks https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.
- HPE has tested with version 4.2.0-201910111434 of the OpenShift Ansible playbooks and recommends using this version when scaling an OCP 4.2 cluster with RHEL worker nodes.

### Make the master nodes non-schedulable

- By default, the OCP 4.2 installer generates Kubernetes manifests which will make the master nodes schedulable. This was done in an attempt to support clusters with smaller footprints.
- However, due to a limitation with Kubernetes where router Pods running on control plane machines will not be reachable by the ingress load balancer, a manifest generated by the installer needs to be modified prior to running the actual installation in order to make the master nodes non-schedulable.
- According to Red Hat, this may be corrected in a future minor version of OCP.

### EFK Logging Stack

- The process of deploying the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) logging stack has changed slightly in OCP 4.2.
- The efk.yml playbook, and supporting efk role, have been updated to work with OCP 4.2.
- NOTE - This updated version of the EFK playbooks will not work with an OCP 4.1 cluster.
