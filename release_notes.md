# Release notes

## Bug Fixes

### Loadbalancers: firewall zone settings lost after a reboot
After a reboot, the two interfaces of the loadbalancers are now assigned to the correct firewall zones.

### dns and dhcp services not automatically restarted after a reboot of a support node
This is now fixed.

## OCP 4.2 support

### Support for OCP version 4.2
This version of the playbooks now supports the deployment of OCP 4.2

### Scaling with RHCOS worker nodes
- OCP 4.2 requires to approve two CSRs whenever a worker node is added to the cluster. the scale.yml playbook was modified to approve these CSRs

### Make the master nodes non-schedulable
- By default, the OCP 4.2 installer generates Kubernetes manifests which will make the master nodes schedulable. This was done in an attempt to support clusters with smaller footprints. However due to a limitation with Kubernetes where router Pods running on control plane machines will not be reachable by the ingress load balancer a manifest generated by the installer needs to be modified prior to running the actual installation in order to make the master nodes non-schedulable. According to Red Hat, this may be corrected in a future minor version of OCP.
